## Why a game?
I created this game to practice and hone my skills writing javascript into a breathing page. It is fully functioning and able to be interacted with by the user. Link to the javascript page here. This was a challenging experience but so rewarding!

## Plain to Pretty
CSS really helped, and Bootstrap! They are fantastic tools and I was thrilled to be able to practice their utilization again.

## Putting it together
Ensuring that everything is linked correctly and all of the functions work was extremely time consuming. Utilizing google, console, as well as notepad to review snippets of the code for correct syntax greatly helped. If you're ready to play, click below!
